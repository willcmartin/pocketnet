# PocketNet

PocketNet is a pocket-sized deep learning library.

This project is heavily inspired by [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch), [micorgrad](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd), [ArrayFlow](https://github.com/a-nico/ArrayFlow), and [tinygrad](https://github.com/geohot/tinygrad).

Run some examples:

`$ PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:. python examples/basics.py`
